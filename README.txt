This folder contains the serialization practice code from the head start java textbook.

In these exercises I learned how to Serialize(write) objects to efficiently save them and deserialize (read) the objects to load them back into the program.

The gameCharacter class built an arrayList of characters with stats and the gameSaveTest class serialized and deserialized their character information.

The ReadAFile and WriteAFile classes do exactly those Read and Write respectively.
